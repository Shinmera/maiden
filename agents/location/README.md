## About
This provides an agent and some functions to perform geolocation. It allows retrieving the address of an ambiguous location, as well as getting the exact geological latitude and longitude coordinates of a place. This is done through the Google Maps geocoding API.

You should set the `:api-key` configuration value of the consumer to the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) key that you obtained.
